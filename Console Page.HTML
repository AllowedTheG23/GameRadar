    <h3>Xbox Series X</h3>
    <p>The Xbox Series X wasn't an essential purchase at launch, but it's clear to see the console is now coming into its own after more than a year on sale. It’s always been a fantastic piece of hardware, mind you, with the potential to solidify itself as an incredible next-gen console in the future. 

        But until now, the new Xbox has been missing the sort of wow factor we've come to expect at the start of each new console generation. There's been a distinct lack of games that truly make the most out of Microsoft's new system, and the feeling that things are more of a continuation of what we've had before isn't helped by the same UI we've been used to seeing on Xbox One. It's easy, then, to feel slightly underwhelmed at first when you boot up the flagship Xbox, but soon the improvements begin to make themselves known.</p>

    <h3>Playsation 5</h3>
     <p>The newest game console generation is here, and to say that Sony's PlayStation 5 has been highly anticipated would be a dramatic understatement. The PS5 is big, fast, and powerful, with a 4K/HDR-capable GPU and an SSD that loads games at lightning speed. For $499.99, it offers gaming performance that well exceeds the PS4 Pro and the Xbox One X, an Ultra HD Blu-ray player (which the PS4 curiously lacked), and a new DualSense gamepad loaded with cool haptic features. The PlayStation 5 is a must-have for PlayStation devotees, and is worthy of sharing our Editors' Choice award alongside the Xbox Series X.</p>

    <h3>Xbox One</h3>
    <p>I think we’ll look back at 2016 as a landmark year for console gaming – the year when manufacturers ditched the whole idea of console generations to follow a more straightforward, less risky smartphone-like release model.
        One where you no longer abandon your existing hardware and customer base every five to seven years. It’s a move that’s already brought us the Xbox One S, PS4 Pro and the Xbox One X – consoles that play the same games as your current one does, but make them look a whole lot better.
        But where does that leave the original Xbox One? From one point of view, in a sad place, destined to become Microsoft’s second-rate system within four years of its launch. Yet from another point of view, the future’s golden.</p>

    <h3>Rainbow Six Siege</h3>
    <iframe width="524px" height="300px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dWlEkrBfwCE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    
    <p>Two years on, Rainbow Six Siege’s player base dwarfs both of those titles combined. Instead of giving up, Ubisoft redoubled its efforts and stayed committed to the idea of Siege, transforming it into one of the most popular shooters on the market. It’s had its issues along the way, but if ever there was a poster child for the benefits of the GaaS (games as a service) model, it would be Rainbow Six Siege.
        
        A large reason for this success is Siege’s rock-solid foundation. Two teams of five operators face off in round-based matches, first to win three rounds takes the match (best of five). There are no respawns and the teams alternate between attacker and defender. The first team to eliminate the opposition or complete the game mode objective wins.</p>

    <h3>Black Ops 4</h3>
    <iframe width="524px" height="300px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fqUCRdTAO-0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
   <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 flung the series into a thrust-jumping, wall running future. With Black Ops 4, we see this long-running series land in far more interesting terrain, even without a campaign. This year, Treyarch is leaning into robust multiplayer modes. Its excellent battle royale addition, Blackout, acts as a nice homage to everything in the Black Ops series. Combined with smart innovations to both Zombies and multiplayer, Black Ops 4 is a strong entry in the series. However, persisting technical issues and a number of already stale multiplayer maps hold Black Ops 4 back from being an even greater package.</p>

 <h3>Minecraft Xbox one Edtion</h3>

<P>Minecraft is about the big things, just as much as it favors the small. It's almost impossible to think of Minecraft without envisioning the picturesque structures, from castles to cities, that have been constructed by fans. But Minecraft is also about the minor touches, and sometimes they are what you remember the most--that feeling of awe as you peer across a forest of snow-capped oak, nearly out of sight, the sense of relaxation as you watch the sun set behind a distant mountain, and the sharp intake of breath as you stare deep into an underground mine lit by glowing pools of red-hot lava. Minecraft: Xbox One Edition offers both worlds, large and small, as well as the tools to create your own voxel-constructed paradise.</P>
