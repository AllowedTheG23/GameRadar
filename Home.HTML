            <p>Right now, the 'PS4 Slim' is the PS4 console that you're going to be able to pick up brand new. It offers the same insides as the original 2013 PS4 but comes with the benefit of a more sleek design. It's still a fantastic console – and we say that knowing full well what the premium capabilities of the 4K-enabled PS4 Pro and the new, ultra-powerful PS5 can do</p>
            <p>The Xbox Series X wasn't an essential purchase at launch, but it's clear to see the console is now coming into its own after more than a year on sale. It’s always been a fantastic piece of hardware, mind you, with the potential to solidify itself as an incredible next-gen console in the future. But until now, the new Xbox has been missing the sort of wow factor we've come to expect at the start of each new console generation. There's been a distinct lack of games that truly make the most out of Microsoft's new system, and the feeling that things are more of a continuation of what we've had before isn't helped by the same UI we've been used to seeing on Xbox One.</p>

        <p>The iPhone 13 (from $799) may not look all that new — other than the new camera lens layout — but under the hood, it's a better flagship all around. Some might see it as an incremental upgrade over the iPhone 12, but it's definitely got a lot going for it.

            The new iPhone’s display is brighter than its predecessor’s. The battery life is noticeably longer. And Apple has improved an already great camera with new sensors and computational photography features that make you feel like a pro (even on a non-Pro phone).</p>
            <p>Dell's G5 Gaming Desktop (starts at $749.99; $929.99 as tested) is a budget gaming PC that delivers enough muscle for casual and multiplayer games at 1080p resolution in a midtower chassis at a competitive price. Our test system is built around Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1650 Super GPU and a 10th Generation Intel Core i5 processor. Despite its trim dimensions, the compact tower and MicroATX motherboard offer room to expand, though we'd recommend springing for Dell's optional power supply (PSU) upgrade if you harbor future expansion or upgrade plans.</p>
