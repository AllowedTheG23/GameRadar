    <h3>Iphone 13 Pro Max</h3>
    <p>The iPhone 13 Pro Max is Apple’s most expensive smartphone, starting at £1,049 ($1,099/A$1,849) – at least £100 more than other models. With the same chips, software, design and camera as the regular sized 13 Pro, size is the key differentiator. The 6.7in 120Hz OLED screen is fantastic: crisp, bright and super smooth, matching Samsung’s very best. As with pin-sharp retina screens before them, faster screens are like a ratchet: once you use one it is very difficult to go back.
    But while it looks great, its large size and solid-feeling stainless steel sides come with a major downside: weight.</p>

    <h3>Iphone XS Max</h3>
    <p>The iPhone XS Max (pronounced 'Ten S Max') was the largest smartphone Apple had ever released when it launched in September 2018. With a 6.5-inch display, hardly any screen bezel, and the now-iconic top-screen notch, it was a dominating presence in the hand.
    Sure, it's no longer one of Apple's latest phones after being superseded by the iPhone 11 range in 2019, the iPhone 12 range in 2020, and lastly the iPhone 13 lineup in 2021. Among those is the iPhone 13 Pro Max, the latest big iPhone which has stretched out to a 6.7-inch display in the same-sized frame, and improved the cameras and specs to boot.</p>

   <h3>Samsung A12</h3>
    <p>The Samsung Galaxy A12 is powered by the octa-core MediaTek Helio P35 chipset with 4GB of RAM and up to 128GB of storage. Out of the box, it runs on One UI 2.5 atop Android 10. The plastic back has a matte finish along with a side-mounted fingerprint scanner.The big talking point according to Samsung is the cameras: a 48MP primary camera (ISOCELL GM2), a 5MP ultra-wide lens, a 2MP macro shooter and a 2MP depth sensor. On the front is an 8MP selfie camera. The lenses are placed in a square housing on the back in a 2x2 configuration.
