    <h2>iBUYPOWER Trace 4 9310</h2>


    <h2>A Reasonable And Ready Prebuilt</h2>

    <p>Our audience is full of self-building enthusiasts when it comes to PC builds, so why are we taking our time to look at a prebuilt from iBUYPOWER? Simple, not everyone wants to take the time this holiday season to build computers for themselves, family members, or friends who are trying to get into PC gaming on a budget.

        That's where the iBUYPOWER Trace 4 9310 comes into play. This is a ready-to-ship model from iBUYPOWER that delivers solid value on Amazon for the asking price of $699.99. This model isn't sold through their custom ordering system on their own site but rather they've paired up with Amazon in order to distribute these units quickly through the holiday season. Don't want to way 7+ days for a custom build and need it pretty quickly? Why not go this route and get take advantage of that Prime delivery service.</p>

        <h2>RGB Intel Core i7 Gaming PC</h2>


        <p>Very good and solid product from an excellent seller you can trust. I order the i7 7700k/16gb version of this machine. It arrived at my house door, in a different country than seller's base, in 5 days.

            The machine was very well packed in a large box which was full of air balloons. Also inside the desktop case was a flexible material to ensure the machine will come in perfect condition without any defects during transportation. I am very happy with my purchase.
            
            I got the i7 7700k, 16gb version of this machine.
            
            The case of the system is large, you can also fit more hard drives if needed in the future. The side panel glass (its plastic) allows the parts of the computer to be visible and thats very good. It has 3 fans (two RGB in the front and one at the back) which ensure good airflow of the system. This pc is a beast, it runs every game and it is still so quiet.

        <h2>ASUS ROG Gaming Pc</h2>
        <p>If you want one of the best gaming PCs in 2021, building your own isn’t an option. Prebuilts used to be overpriced, underpowered options compared to building your own PC, but thanks to the GPU shortage, they are downright good deals. And that’s what the Asus ROG GA35 G35DX is — a great deal for 2021.

            I have some issues with it compared to boutique options from Origin and Maingear, but the ROG GA35 still has plenty of power to impress. It’s not too expensive, either, at least in the pricing crisis that’s plaguing PC components right now. If I didn’t already have a graphics card from waiting in line at Best Buy, the ROG GA35 would be near the top of my list of options.</p>
